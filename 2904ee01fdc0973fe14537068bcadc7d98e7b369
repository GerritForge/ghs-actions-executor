      "message": "I have performed the following tests:\n1. started local site\n2. pushed in to `master` in a loop (500)\n3. while pushing called `BitmapGenerationAction` several time so that entries are added to `.ghs-packs.log`\n4. still while pushing called `PreserveOutdatedBitmapsAction` a few times interchangeably with `BitmapGenerationAction`\n5. before the loop finished I have called again `BitmapGenerationAction`\n6. after the loop finished I have called `PreserveOutdatedBitmapsAction` so that last bitmap is preserved and all previous bitmaps are in `preserved` dir\n7. called push for review\n\nI haven\u0027t observed any issues in pushing, actions (all were reported successful) or in Gerrit log. IOW it works as expected 💪",
